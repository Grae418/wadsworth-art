"Hi! My name’s Fynn!
I’m a multi-media artist and writer from Iowa. My work is inspired by both the fantasy and horror genres, blending my love of magic, mysteries, and history all into one. Much of my personal work is inspired by my love of classic literature, and I love to include queer characters wherever I can."

"I work in everything from textiles to printmaking, but my main love is illustration and graphic novels! I have a handful of self-published works under my belt, including “Tulips and Pansies: An Illustrated Queer History of Central College” and “Unlikely Friends”."
